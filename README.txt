I am a Computer Science student studying here at UoB. While I was performing some basic
recon, I noticed a vulnerability.

After performing a port scan on the IP 10.x.xxx.xx (I found this by using the ARP protocol to discover live hosts while in Varley Park).
I noticed a slightly outdated version of vsftpd (3.0.3) was operating on the open port #21. As of 29th March, this FTP
server software became vulnerable to remote Denial of Service attacks. (See attatched
screenshots). More information on this exploit can be found at: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49719

A newer version of this software (3.0.4) is now available and is patched to this vulnerability.

I wanted to let you know of this once I discovered it, so that you are able to patch this up.

Best wishes :)
